    <h1>
      Are Project Managers Really Needed — Or Only Noticed When Things Go Wrong?
    </h1>

    <p class="lead">
      When a project goes live successfully, appreciation usually flows toward
      the product, the technology, or the business outcome.
      Rarely does anyone pause to ask what role the project manager played.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ironically, the smoother a project runs, the more invisible the project
      manager becomes. And this often leads PMs to quietly question whether
      their value is recognised only during failure.
    </p>

    <h2>When Projects Succeed, the PM’s Work Disappears</h2>
    <p>
      Good project management is preventive by nature. Risks are addressed early,
      expectations are aligned before conflict, and issues are resolved before
      escalation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this happens consistently, success appears effortless. From the
      outside, it may look like the project simply “ran on its own.”
    </p>

    <h2>When Things Go Wrong, Visibility Increases</h2>
    <p>
      Delays, scope creep, or misalignment quickly draw attention back to the
      project manager. The same role that was invisible during success suddenly
      becomes central during uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This contrast can feel uncomfortable — not because PMs seek recognition,
      but because visibility is often tied only to problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Other Teams Are Easier to Appreciate</h2>
    <p>
      Teams that deliver tangible outputs — features, reports, revenue — are
      naturally easier to recognise. Their contributions are visible and
      measurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project managers deliver something less obvious: structure, clarity, and
      stability. These outcomes are felt across the project, but rarely noticed
      explicitly.
    </p>

    <h2>The Value of Invisible Work</h2>
    <p>
      Much of a project manager’s impact lies in what never happens — escalations
      that were avoided, risks that never materialised, and misalignment resolved
      early.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absence of chaos is often mistaken for the absence of effort.
    </p>

    <h2>So, Are Project Managers Really Needed?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes — but their value is often preventive rather than performative.
      Organisations tend to recognise the importance of project management most
      clearly when it is missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-run project does not mean less work was done. It usually means the
      right work was done quietly, at the right time.
    </p>

    <h2>A Note to Project Managers</h2>
    <p>
      Lack of visibility does not mean lack of value. If your projects feel calm,
      predictable, and under control, you are likely doing your job well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best project management rarely draws attention — and that is often its
      greatest success.
    </p>

      If this perspective resonates with you, you’re not alone.
      Thoughtful conversations about project work deserve space.
